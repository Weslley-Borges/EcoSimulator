## About
EcoSimulator is a small project that aimed to simulate the dynamics between populations of rabbits, foxes, and local vegetation.

This is a project that was conceived earlier this year (2022), while I was attending biology classes, however, it only started to be coded on February 22nd. Unfortunately, I still haven't been able to create more complex models.
